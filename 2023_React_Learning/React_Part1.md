# 2023 React Learning

#### ReactJs Basics 

* **Reasons to learn ReactJS**
* React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture-based library that plays the role of “V” which means view. It designs simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right component when your data changes. The declarative view makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.

* **Prerequisite:**
* Before you start learning ReactJS, we assume that you have knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are few others skill sets that will help you to complete this tutorial at your best pace.

####  **React Features:**

* **Use JSX:** JSX is faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript. It makes it easier for us to create templates.

* **Virtual DOM:** Virtual DOM exists which is like a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. So for every object that exists in the original DOM, there is an object for that in React Virtual DOM. It is exactly the same, but it does not have the power to directly change the layout of the document. Manipulating DOM is slow, but manipulating Virtual DOM is fast as nothing gets drawn on the screen.

* **One-way Data Binding:** One-way data binding gives you better view over your application.

* **Component:** A Component is one of the core building blocks of React. In other words, we can say that every application you will develop in React will be made up of pieces called components. Components make the task of building UIs much easier.

* **Performance:** ReactJS use JSX, which is faster compared to normal JavaScript and HTML. Virtual DOM is a less time taking procedure to update webpages content.
